# GreatReads

## Premise: 

This project is modeled after GoodReads, a blog site that allows users to review books that they have read and add them to their own digital bookshelf.


## User Story:

- Users should be able to create their own profiles where they can add books to their bookshelves and review them.
- Users should also be able to view the individual book pages to read reviews and ratings.
